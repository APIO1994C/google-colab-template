# Bioconductor

This is the presentation material of Bioconductor presented in **Advanced Bioinformatics 1** (2021 Fall semester), and based on two papers: 

Huber, Wolfgang, et al. "Orchestrating high-throughput genomic analysis with Bioconductor." *Nature methods* 12.2 (2015): 115-121.

"Gentleman, Robert C., et al. "Bioconductor: open software development for computational biology and bioinformatics." *Genome biology* 5.10 (2004): 1-16.".


It includes pdf file and ipynb file. 

## Tips for exercise with ipynb file

Because Bioconductor is R open project, this exercise material was written based on R kernel. There are some additional works to use R kernel in jupyter notebook. Please refer following sites.
